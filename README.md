mgpt - A Command-Line AI Assistant
mgpt is a powerful command-line tool that integrates OpenAI's GPT models and OpenManus for natural language processing and script automation. Whether you want to chat with an AI, generate Python scripts, or execute tasks, mgpt has you covered!

**Features**
•	Interactive chat mode with GPT-4o.
•	Delegate tasks to OpenManus for script generation and execution.
•	Supports piping input and verbose debugging.
•	Customizable via environment variables.

**Prerequisites**
Before installing mgpt, ensure you have the following:
•	Python 3.6+: Installed on your system.
•	pip: Python package manager.
•	Git: For cloning the repository (optional).
•	OpenAI API Key: Required for GPT functionality.
•	OpenManus: Optional, for script automation features.

**Installation**

**1. Clone the Repository (Optional)**
   
If you’re installing from GitHub:
git clone https://github.com/mietzekatzlol/mgpt.git
cd mgpt
Replace yourusername with your GitHub username or use the actual repository URL.

**2. Install Dependencies**

Install the required Python packages:
pip install openai
The openai package is the only direct dependency for basic functionality. If you use OpenManus, additional dependencies may be required (see OpenManus section below).

**3. Download or Create mgpt.py**

•	If cloned from GitHub, the script is already in the repository.
•	Otherwise, copy the mgpt.py script into your working directory (e.g., ~/mgpt/).

**4. Make the Script Executable**

Set execute permissions:
chmod +x mgpt.py

**Configuration**

**1. Set Up OpenAI API Key**

mgpt requires an OpenAI API key for GPT functionality. Set it as an environment variable:
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key_here"
•	Replace your_openai_api_key_here with your actual key from OpenAI.
•	To make this permanent, add the line to your ~/.bashrc, ~/.zshrc, or equivalent shell configuration file.

**2. Define an Alias in .bashrc**

To run mgpt conveniently without typing ./mgpt.py every time, define an alias in your ~/.bashrc:
Open the file: 
•  nano ~/.bashrc
•  Add this line at the end (adjust the path to where mgpt.py is located): 
bash
•  alias mgpt='python3 /home/yourusername/mgpt/mgpt.py'
Replace /home/yourusername/mgpt/mgpt.py with the actual path to your mgpt.py. 
•  Save and exit (Ctrl+O, Enter, Ctrl+X in nano). 
•  Apply the changes: source ~/.bashrc
Now you can simply type mgpt to run the script from anywhere!

**3. (Optional) Configure OpenManus**

If you want to use OpenManus for script generation and execution:

•	Install OpenManus: Follow the official OpenManus documentation to install it. Typically, it’s a Python script (main.py) that you place in a directory (e.g., ~/OpenManus/).

•	Update Path: Ensure the openmanus_path variable in mgpt.py points to your OpenManus main.py. Default is: 

openmanus_path = "/home/jumpmanjr/OpenManus/main.py"

Edit this line if your path differs: 

•  nano mgpt.py

•  Dependencies: OpenManus may require additional packages (e.g., shutil, psutil). Install them as needed: 

•	 pip install psutil


**4. Test the Setup**

Verify everything works (after setting the alias):

mgpt "Hello, how are you?"
Expected output: A response from GPT-4o, like "I'm doing great, thanks! How about you?"

**Basic GPT Query**

mgpt "Write a haiku about space"
Output: A haiku generated by GPT-4o.

**Interactive Chat Mode**

mgpt --chat
Type prompts interactively; exit with exit or Ctrl+C.


**OpenManus Task**

**Generate and execute a script:**
mgpt -o "write a simple python script that checks disk usage and prints the results, save it as check_disk_usage.py, and execute it"
Output:
Content successfully saved to check_disk_usage.py
Total: 343.19 GB
Used: 48.04 GB
Free: 277.65 GB

Add -v for detailed debugging:
mgpt -o -v "write a simple python script that says hello, save it, and execute it"


**Notes**

•	Ensure your OpenAI API key is set before running GPT commands.

•	For OpenManus features, confirm the script path and dependencies are correctly configured.

•	The script assumes a Unix-like environment (Linux/macOS). For Windows, adjust paths and commands accordingly (e.g., use python mgpt.py instead of mgpt).

**Troubleshooting**

•	API Key Error: Verify OPENAI_API_KEY is set (echo $OPENAI_API_KEY).

•	OpenManus Not Found: Check the openmanus_path in mgpt.py.

•	Alias Not Working: Ensure the path in the alias is correct and run source ~/.bashrc.

•	No Output: Use -v to debug OpenManus execution.
